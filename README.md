# Drag and Drop Tic Tac Toe

Welcome to Drag and Drop Tic Tac Toe, a game inspired by the work of [tanmancan](https://github.com/tanmancan/tic-tac-toe).

## How to Play

### Objective

The objective of the game is to create a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of your objects (X or O) on the game board, indicating a winning move.

### Game Rules

1. The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.

2. Players take turns, beginning with one player (Player X) and alternating between players.

3. Each player has three draggable boxes on their side.

4. Players must use all three of their objects (X or O) before they can start moving or dragging their objects around the board.

5. During their turn, a player can drag one of their objects and drop it onto an empty cell on the game board.

6. Players cannot move other player's objects.

7. Players cannot stack objects on top of each other in a single cell. Each cell can hold only one object.

### Starting the Game

- Players are randomly assigned as Player X or Player O.

- Drag and drop your objects onto the empty cells on the game board.

### Winning the Game

The game continues until one player successfully creates a line of three of their objects horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The player who achieves this wins the game.

### New Round

If you want to start a new round, click the "New Round" button.

### Valid Move Rules

To make the game more interesting, we've added a rule to control how your game pieces (X or O) can be moved. Here's a simple guide:

- **Center Star Move:**
  - If your game piece is in the center cell (cell 4), you can move it to any of the surrounding cells (0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8).
  - This creates a star-shaped movement pattern.

- **Side-to-Center Moves:**
  - If your game piece is in one of the side cells (0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8), you can only move it to the center cell (cell 4).
  - This adds a strategic element to the game, requiring you to navigate through the center.

These rules make the game more dynamic and strategic, providing a unique twist to the traditional Tic Tac Toe. Have fun playing!
